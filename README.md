- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Boluwatito-Adigun and I am a newbie in the field of Cybersecurity security. I am driven and passionate about safeguarding peopleâ€™s and organizationâ€™s data, assets, and  information. I enjoy working with technology, analyzing and solving complex problems.

-ðŸ‘€ With no previous experience, Iâ€™m looking for an entry-level cybersecurity position that will foster my drive and thirst for knowledge while protecting critical infrastructures. Just concluding the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, I believe I have the basic skills for entry level positions as I continue to develop my skills and experiences through real life scenarios.
